## About

<img class="game-logo pixel-art" src="{{ '/assets/img/the-quest-game-logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The Quest for the Game">

The Quest for the Game is based on the short film series [The Quest for Soda](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPhs_MpGPlg9gD7TQp-APjz5g2SNIPe7) and stars the main characters from said series, the Danish teenage buddies Svenn and Svennz.

The evil Agent Yonas gives Svenn and Svennz an offer they can't refuse. He offers to give them the latest and greatest video game that everyone wants to own, in exchange for one Coca-Cola and one Pepsi. Piece of cake, right?

Unfortunately life isn't so easy for Svenn and Svennz. On their quest they have to battle enemies and outrun the store owner Rasmusen more than once. The goal is to get to Yonas's castle and give him the soda he desires so much, so that our heroes can get the video game.

## Gameplay

The game includes many cutscenes in which the player does not directly participate, other than interacting with dialogue boxes using the `Interact` button. It is also possible to speed up each sentence by pressing the `Interact` button while the text is still being written to the screen. When the player can move, background music is played.

To progress in the environment, the player may have to collect objects or interact with them in other ways. To do so, the player should face the object and press the `Interact` button. The player also occasionally has to talk to NPCs in the game, which is done in the exact same way.

In battles, the player can choose between attacking the enemy or healing themselves. It may be necessary to heal oneself to some degree in order to defeat the enemy.
